/** Discovery sequence **/

This part describes the initial discovery process of a new Worker in the network.
The network refers to the local node and peers are remote Workers.
The discovery sequence separates between 2 parts:
New Worker in the network - don't have peers info in the persistent storage.
Previously logged Worker - Have some stored peers info.
All the messages are in JSONRPC 2.0 format

New Worker in the network:
The worker has hardcoded addresses of bootstraping nodes and they would be
the first connection to the network. Their goal is to be a gateway to
the network and returns DNS Seeds. Incase they are offline the Worker could
find other workers IP's on the internet and add them manualy using the CLI.

msg #1 Worker to a boostrap node - ping

// id : The Server MUST reply with the same value in the Response object if included. This member is used to correlate the context between the two objects.
// An identifier established by the Client that MUST contain a value

// from : a param holding base58 of the nodes public key (PeerInfo)

// findpeers : boolean indicating if a peer list should be returned

// ? Possibly the Ethereum signing key

{
	"jsonrpc" : "2.0",
	"method" : "ping",
	"params" : [{"from":"", "findpeers" : ""}],
	"id" : "",
}

msg #2 Boostrap node to the Worker

// the response object :

// status : 200 ok, otherwise error


// seeds : list of A DNS records (potential peers)

// to : node_id : the requester_id

// At that point the Worker starts to look for peers activley

* Synchronize sequence *

This sequence describes on how a new Worker gets in sync with the network state
it does not aim to describe state-transitions of the network which will happen every epoch
and will be described later at a sequence called 'Passing the torch'
The sync process will refer to epoch number as the logical sequence of time.
Same as block number in a blockchain.
The Worker's goal is to be in sync till the current epoch state.

The synchronization of secret-contracts will include:
1) Contract code
2) initial payload (delta 0)
3) all state changes (deltas)

// Enigma smart contract stores in some way or another:
+--------------------+----------------+-----------+---------+------+
| secret-contracts   | deployed code  | delta 1   | delta 2 | ...  |
| address            | + payload hash | hash      | hash    | ...  |
+--------------------+----------------+-----------+---------+------+
| 0x01...            | asd..          | h(d1)     | h(d2)   | ...  |
| 0x02...            | bk2..          | h(d1)     | h(d2)   | ...  |
| 0x03...            | sg3..          | h(d1)     | h(d2)   | ...  |
