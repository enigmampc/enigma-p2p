/**
 * The Runtime Manager:
 * -    Manages all the the different Runtimes.
 * -    Event Manager
 * -    Subscribes to all of the Runtimes
 * -    Propagates Requests between them upon some event.
 * -    Each event is a Trigger to some Action, that's all.
 * -    Every runtime must implement 2 functions:
 * -      setChannel(communicator), communicator is a part of channel that speaks to the Runtime Manager
 * -      type():String, returns the type of the runtime so the communicators can be mapped.
 * -
 * Runtimes:
 * -    CLI
 * -    Core
 * -    Node
 * -    Ethereum
 * -    JsonRpcAPI
 * The CLI Runtime:
 * -   Asynchronous commands from a user client
 * -   A User will start the control flow
 * -   Set of definitions is required
 * The Core Runtime:
 * -   Asynchronous Inter-Process Communication
 * -   Relays messages between Core & the enigma-p2p software
 * -   Based on ZeroMQ Response-Request model, Core is the Responder and enigma-p2p is the Requester
 * -   Takes requests from the p2p, sends them to Core
 * -   Has a known format of defined Req/Res messages
 * The Node Runtime:
 * -   Asynchronous Controller that manages the P2P networking stuff
 * -   Highly coupled to the protocol specifics
 * -   Has a set of components that are responsible for different things such as:
 * -    -   Managing Connections
 * -    -   Sending/Receiving States
 * The Ethereum Runtime:
 * -    Asynchronous Controller that writes and reads data from Ethereum.
 * -    The interface to the Enigma.sol contract.
 * -    Manages Worker registration, state validation, task commitments and more.
 * The JsonRpcApi:
 * -    Asynchronous Server that responds to user requests (dApp)
 * -    Based on JsonRpc server and a remote Client
 * -    secret contract users will query the workers via this API
